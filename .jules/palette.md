## 2026-05-22 - [Secure Authenticated Downloads]
**Learning:** Using `window.open` for authenticated file downloads (like invoices) bypasses the application's auth header logic unless tokens are passed in the URL (insecure). Fetching as a Blob via `fetchWithAuth` ensures security and allows for UI loading feedback.
**Action:** Always prefer `fetchWithAuth` + `URL.createObjectURL` for secure, async-feedback file downloads.

## 2026-05-22 - [Icon-only Button Accessibility]
**Learning:** Many icon-only buttons in the existing codebase missed `type="button"`, causing accidental form submissions, and lacked `aria-label` for screen readers.
**Action:** Ensure all icon-only buttons have explicit `type="button"` and descriptive `aria-label`.
## 2026-06-15 - [Icon-only Button Accessibility and Form Submission Prevention]
**Learning:** Many interactive buttons in complex components like `AIAnalysis.tsx` missed `type="button"`, which could cause accidental form submissions if placed near forms. Additionally, utility buttons with only icons (like the send button or clear search) lacked `aria-label` attributes, impacting screen reader users.
**Action:** Always add `type="button"` defensively to non-submit buttons and ensure explicit `aria-label` attributes on any icon-only interactive element.
